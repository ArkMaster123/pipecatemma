# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a fully functional realtime voice interface using OpenAI's Realtime API with speech-to-speech architecture. The system enables natural voice conversations with an AI assistant named Emma, providing low-latency audio streaming, real-time transcription, and robust connection management. The implementation uses WebRTC for optimal browser performance and direct integration with OpenAI's `gpt-4o-realtime-preview-2024-10-01` model.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to establish a voice connection with Emma AI assistant, so that I can have natural conversations without typing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks "Connect to Emma" THEN the system SHALL create a new OpenAI Realtime API session
2. WHEN the session is created successfully THEN the system SHALL establish a WebRTC connection with audio streaming
3. WHEN the connection is established THEN the system SHALL display a visual indicator showing connected status
4. IF the API key is missing or invalid THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
5. WHEN the connection fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback and allow retry

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to speak to Emma and receive voice responses, so that I can have natural conversations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user starts speaking THEN the system SHALL capture audio from the microphone with noise suppression
2. WHEN audio is captured THEN the system SHALL stream it to OpenAI Realtime API in real-time
3. WHEN Emma responds THEN the system SHALL play the audio response through the speakers
4. WHEN the conversation is active THEN the system SHALL maintain continuous audio streaming without interruption
5. IF microphone access is denied THEN the system SHALL display appropriate permissions guidance

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to control my voice input and audio output, so that I can manage the conversation flow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks "Start Listening" THEN the system SHALL begin capturing microphone input
2. WHEN the user clicks "Stop Listening" THEN the system SHALL stop capturing microphone input
3. WHEN the user clicks "Mute" THEN the system SHALL mute Emma's audio output
4. WHEN the user clicks "Unmute" THEN the system SHALL restore Emma's audio output
5. WHEN controls are activated THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a transcript of my conversation with Emma, so that I can review what was discussed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user speaks THEN the system SHALL display the transcribed text in real-time
2. WHEN Emma responds THEN the system SHALL display Emma's response text
3. WHEN the conversation continues THEN the system SHALL maintain a scrollable conversation history
4. WHEN the transcript area is full THEN the system SHALL automatically scroll to show the latest messages
5. WHEN the session ends THEN the system SHALL clear the transcript

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to disconnect from Emma cleanly, so that I can end the conversation properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks "Disconnect" THEN the system SHALL terminate the OpenAI Realtime session
2. WHEN disconnecting THEN the system SHALL stop all audio streams and release microphone access
3. WHEN disconnected THEN the system SHALL update the UI to show disconnected status
4. WHEN the session expires THEN the system SHALL automatically disconnect and notify the user
5. IF the connection drops unexpectedly THEN the system SHALL detect the failure and update the UI accordingly

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust error handling and recovery, so that the voice interface remains stable and user-friendly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network connectivity is lost THEN the system SHALL attempt to reconnect automatically
2. WHEN the OpenAI API returns an error THEN the system SHALL log the error and display user-friendly messages
3. WHEN WebRTC connection fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback options or clear error guidance
4. WHEN browser compatibility issues occur THEN the system SHALL detect and inform the user of requirements
5. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL handle gracefully with appropriate user feedback

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want Emma to have a consistent personality and voice, so that the conversation feels natural and engaging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Emma responds THEN the system SHALL use the configured voice (alloy) consistently
2. WHEN Emma speaks THEN the system SHALL maintain the defined personality traits (friendly, helpful, warm)
3. WHEN conversations continue THEN the system SHALL maintain context and conversational flow
4. WHEN interruptions occur THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully without losing context
5. WHEN the session starts THEN the system SHALL initialize Emma with the proper instructions and configuration

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want the voice interface to work smoothly across different browsers and devices, so that I can use it reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using Chrome, Firefox, or Safari THEN the system SHALL function with full feature support
2. WHEN using mobile devices THEN the system SHALL adapt the interface for touch interactions
3. WHEN using different audio devices THEN the system SHALL work with various microphones and speakers
4. WHEN the browser lacks WebRTC support THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate fallback or guidance
5. WHEN permissions are required THEN the system SHALL guide users through the permission process
